// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a = 2
b = 5
    sum = 7

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

# check if a number is Even or Odd 
a = 2
b = 2
if sum of a + b is equal to even
    print ("Even")
else:
    print ("Odd")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 

userinput = (5 random numbers)
    num = 6
    num = 1
    num = 8
    num = 3
    num = 5

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

Numbers =[6, + 1, + 8, + 3, + 5]
Sum of the five numbers = 23 
Average of the five numbers = 23 divided by 5 equals to 4.6


c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

if find the minimum number
    print ("minumum number")
if find the maximun number
    print ("maximun number")
else:
    print("not found")

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

In step B:  Set of five random numbers were genertated from user
            Added the sum of set of five random numbers
            Then calculated the average of the five set of numbers 

In step C:  Used the set of five random numbers generated by user to find the minimum number and maximum number
            Perform if and print statement to condition to meet desired results
            IF desired results are not found, conditioned a else statemnet to result "not found" command
